          <p>
            Red foxes are by far the most common and well known foxes out there.
            Red foxes have primarily red/orange fur but have a gray/white color
            from their chin to stomach and on the tip of their tail. They also
            have black fur on their feet and ear tips. Red foxes are typically
            about 2 feet tall and 3 feet long. This breed is native to and can
            be found all around North America. Red foxes have amazing hearing
            and can hear low frequency sounds that help them track rodents.

          <p>
            While these foxes can be good pets under some circumstances they are
            not fully domesticated at this point so they require much more
            unique care. These foxes require a lot of room to run and love to
            dig so they are not the best for an indoor pet. They can be a great
            outdoor pet but they are still a bit unpredictable due to the fact
            they are only partially domesticated. Likewise, their urine has a
            particularly bad odor that has not been shown in other breeds.
