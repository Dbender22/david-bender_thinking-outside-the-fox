          Thinking Outside the fox is a site dedicated to spreading information
        about the domesticated fox and how this animal fits into our modern day
        world. 
        </p>
        
      <p>
           Domesticated foxes are the result of many years of selective
        breeding to make them more inclined to seek human companionship. While
        the process still has a way to go, the prospect of having a pet fox
        today is much more feasible than it was even 50 years ago. Before making
        the major decision of adopting this animal into your home it is
        important to have the information that will help you on your journey.
