            Thinking Outside the fox is a site dedicated to spreading
            information about the domesticated fox and how this animal fits into
            our modern day world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Domesticated foxes are the result of many years of selective
            breeding to make them more inclined to seek human companionship.
            While the process still has a way to go, the prospect of having a
            pet fox today is much more feasible than it was even 50 years ago.
            Before making the major decision of adopting this animal into your
            home it is important to have the information that will help you on
            your journey.
