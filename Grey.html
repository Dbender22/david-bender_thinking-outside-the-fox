          <p>
            The Gray Fox is primarily a cream/orange color mixed with the gray
            that gives it its name. The top of its head and back are a gray and
            white mixture while the tail tip is a dark black. The underside of
            the coat is covered in various spots of red in a similar color to
            the red fox. They are typically about a foot tall and anywhere from
            2 to 3 feet long. They are most commonly found in North America.
            Gray foxes are also known to be good at climbing trees.

          <p>
            Gray foxes have been shown to be very friendly and calm in the
            presence of humans, and for that reason make relatively good pets.
            They do not have a pungent smell that can be found with some other
            breeds but can still be an animal that needs a bit more training to
            keep them out of things they shouldn’t be in. Likewise, similar to
            most other foxes listed here they need a good area to play around in
            and shouldn’t be confined to a small space.
