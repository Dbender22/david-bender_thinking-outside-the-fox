          <p>
            In the winter the arctic fox has an almost fully white coat that
            allows it to camouflage itself extremely well in the arctic
            environment. Once summer comes the fox sheds this fur and replaces
            it with a coat of more grays and browns to match its environment
            Unlike other foxes the males and females can be quite different in
            size. They can be anywhere from 1 to 3 feet in length overall. This
            breed has been found in many places, including Europe, Asia, and
            North America. The arctic fox survives in some of the harshest
            habitats in the world.

          <p>
            These foxes, while similar to other foxes in size and anatomy, are
            not as good pets compared to options like the red and silver fox. It
            has the same urine smell as the red fox but its primary difference
            is their issue with hot temperatures. If you live in a place where
            the temperature can get warm then you will need to take extra
            measures to keep them cool at those times of year.
