          <p>
            Fennec foxes are a mix of tan a brown colors with orangish more
            saturated brown on top and a lighter more white color on the bottom.
            They are usually about 12-14 inches long and 8 inches tall. This
            breed is native to and primarily found in North Africa. Their large
            ears help them survive the desert heat by storing extra blood
            vessels to retain water.

          <p>
            These are the most common and popular type of pet fox. They are a
            nice small size that suits most people, but this does require the
            owners extra awareness in keeping track of where they are. They also
            have a long life expectancy. They are very friendly towards humans
            but can be a bit of a problem with other pets or children as they
            can bite a bit similar to a cat. They are also known for being quite
            loud so this should be taken note of.
