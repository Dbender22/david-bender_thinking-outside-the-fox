          <p>
            Bat-Eared Foxes generally have a gray color with a sand tint to it.
            This color fades to a darker version around the face, ears, back,
            and tail. They are relatively small, usually standing at about 2
            feet long and 1 foot high. They generally stay in large packs in
            numbers of about 50 or more. This breed is found in both east and
            south Africa. Similar to the Fennec Fox this breed is known for
            storing many blood vessels in the ears to deal with the harsh desert
            environment.

          <p>
            These foxes, while not so different from the other breeds discussed,
            are not as commonly kept as pets. They require a lot of room to roam
            similar to the Red and Silver fox, and can be quite curious. Their
            African habitat can make them interesting to have as a pet, as most
            other places are quite different from their natural home. That being
            said, there are many instances of people having them as pets under
            the right care.
