          <p>
            For the longest time foxes were seen as untamable wild animals, and
            while modern domesticated foxes are not quite on the same level as
            dogs and cats they have still made immense progress in the not so
            distant past.
          </p>

          <p>
            While the domestication of the wild fox had been in part started
            before the mid 20th century it is mainly agreed that the start of
            what we have today came from the experiment done in 1959 by the
            geneticist Dimitri Belyaev. Belyaev had read Charles Darwin’s
            studies on the domestic traits of animals and this piqued his
            interest. Belyaev was interested in how the domestication of wolves
            from dogs happened and based his experiment on that. The key
            difference was that in his experiment he used the silver fox
            population of Russia as the test subjects.
          </p>

            alt=""
          />

          <p>
            In the 1930s Belyaev was a student in Moscow at the Ivanova
            Agricultural Academy. After his graduation and service in WWII
            Belyaev was able to get a job at the Institute for Fur Breeding
            Animals. After some time and experience with the animals at the
            institute as well as some time at Ivanova Agricultural Academy he
            had a better understanding of the traits of domesticated animals.
            Physical traits included patterns of fur with spots or streaks of
            color, short and/or curly tails, floppy and/or big ears, as well as
            an overall more juvenile appearance to their wild counterparts.
            There were also differences in behavior. Domesticated animals, while
            obviously being more friendly towards humans, also exhibited reduced
            stress and hormone levels as well as a longer breeding season. These
            traits are now known as the domestication syndrome.
          </p>

          <p>
            Belyaev found it interesting that regardless of what humans chose
            certain animals for they all ended up exhibiting these traits in one
            way or another. He made the conclusion that this process must start
            with people choosing the animals that are reacting more positively
            to humans to begin with. Belyaev hypothesized that these traits that
            were found in domestic animals must in some way be initially linked
            with the animals that are already more tame to begin with. So using
            this he began his experiment.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1959 Belyaev decided to do this experiment with an animal that he
            had already spent much time with at the institut. That being the
            silver fox. With each generation of foxes Belyaev and his team would
            select the 10% of foxes they deemed to be most tame and would use
            them to breed the next generation. Using a scale they developed for
            measuring tameness the research team could continue to select groups
            of foxes and see if the following generation exhibited more traits
            from the domestication syndrome. As the project was underway Belyaev
            died in 1985 but Lyudmila Trut, a member of his team who had become
            the lead researcher, continued the experiment. Trut was around 25 at
            this time and in the time since major findings have been found in
            the experiment.

          />

          <p>
            The experiment has been going on for nearly 6 decades and the
            resulting foxes today are nothing short of amazing. The foxes
            selected exclusively for their rating on the tameness scale have
            produced an amazing selection of domesticated foxes. These foxes
            will lick people's hands, can be picked up and petted, will wag
            their tails while humans are present and will even whine when humans
            leave them. The stress levels of these animals are about half of the
            levels exhibited from the first generation. Likewise, their
            serotonin levels are much higher, meaning they are noticeably
            happier. Similarly, these foxes exhibit the physical traits of
            domestication such as floppy ears, curly tails, rounder snouts, more
            juvenile bodies, and dog-like fur patterns. Another surprising
            change found is that, differently from wild foxes, these foxes are
            able to follow the “human gaze” in the same way dogs do. In the
            early days of the experiment the foxes made up a small percentage of
            the group. Today they make up nearly the entire group.
            Interestingly, a similar experiment was started not long after this
            one in which foxes were bred for more aggressive traits. These foxes
            did not exhibit the traits of domestication.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, this experiment has been able to prove Belyaev’s hypothesis
            correct. Animals selected on tameness are inclined to become much
            more domesticated than the average fox even without exposure to
            humans. A result of this experiment is a wide range of domestic
            foxes in the modern day.
