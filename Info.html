          <h2>Info and Care</h2>

          <h2>Diet</h2>

          <h4>Meat</h4>

          <p>
            Pretty much every fox hunts and eats small or sometimes relatively
            large rodents, so the proteins and benefits from meat is a very
            important part of their diet. In some cases owners will feed their
            pet foxes dog food as a substitute for actual meat. This can work as
            long as it is mixed with fruits, vegetables and bugs. It is
            important to note that if you do opt to feed your fox real meat it
            needs to be full animals and not processed grocery store bought
            meat. The foxes need all parts of the animal to stay healthy and
            happy. Likewise, most premium dog foods will give them these
            nutrients as well.
          </p>

          <h4>Insect, Fruits, and Vegetables</h4>

          <p>
            Like meat, insects make up a large part of a foxes diet in the wild.
            A breed like the Fennec Fox will actually find and eat much more of
            this than meat. So including real insects with even just dog food is
            important. Likewise, both fruits and vegetables can help your fox.
            Vegetables can be given with your foxes meals in small portions each
            day. Nothing more than a handful is about the max they need each
            day, and this can vary on the size of the fox. Fruits on the other
            hand, while not inherently bad for foxes should be only given as
            treats every so often. Foxes like many types of berries and cherries
            specifically have been shown to help with the more pungent urine
            smell some foxes have. Similar to dogs it is important to note that
            grapes and raisins have been found as harmful to foxes and should
            not be given to them. Finally, it is advised to not give your fox
            anything with grain in it as they do not eat this in the wild.
          </p>

          <h2>Enviroment</h2>

          <p>
            Foxes can not be trained in the same way as a cat or dog, and also
            require a different environment from them. It is not often suggested
            that you keep a pet fox indoors. The one exception to this rule in
            the fox world is the fennec fox that can be more easily kept indoors
            24/7 than other breeds. That being said, all foxes need room to roam
            and play. The fennec foxes smaller size allows it to perhaps do this
            indoors as long as you have a big enough area, but nearly all other
            foxes need an enclosure outdoors. You can more easily keep a fox
            indoors when they are young but as they get older then tend to get
            more destructive. This doesn't mean you can never have them indoors
            but rather that you need to have an outdoor space they can stay in
            when you are not around or for any other reason. This is where the
            fox enclosure comes in. Fox enclosures need to have plenty of room
            for the fox to move and should be made dig proof and be enclosed on
            all sides. Aside from the basic structure of the enclosure there
            should also be many things to stimulate your fox while they are
            alone. This can include things for them to climb on and run through
            as well as a house similar to a dog house for them to sleep in. It
            also goes without saying that they should have access to food and
            water. Finally, foxes, like any animal, need to be entertained in
            order to stay happy so it is definitely suggested to give them fun
            toys and activities they can do with or without you. This can
            include regular dog toys, puzzle feeders, pools, sandboxes, etc. It
            is also good to walk your fox often. You should get them used to
            this at a young age and similar to a cat a harness is very helpful.
